# Lending-Loan-Case-Study


# Problem Statement
Solving this assignment will give you an idea about how real business problems are solved using <b>Exploratory Data AnalysisDA</b>. In this case study, apart from applying the techniques you have learnt in EDA, you will also develop a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and understand how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers.

# Business Understanding
You work for a <b>consumer finance company</b> which specialises in lending various types of loans to customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. 
  
Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:

 1. If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company

 2.  If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.
